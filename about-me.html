                        I help people building their practical skills in data analysis and 
                        produce work they feel proud of. I do this by designing engaging courses, 
                        giving customized training, and offering consulting services 
                        for those working or studying in the fields of Economics, Finance, or Marketing.

                        and what it takes to get results.

                <p>
                    My background is in Economics with a focus on applied statistics and econometrics. 
                    I have a Master of Science in Economics from Freie Universität Berlin, where I pursued the quantitative methods track. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    But despite what you just read, I did not enter the stats & quant world with a natural flair for math. 
                    And I certainly did not exit with a master degree before dedicating insane hours and effort.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My undergraduate program in economics was math-heavy. About as heavy as a technical science program for math-loving people. 
                    And believe me, I had zero love for math back then. To make things worse, it was math designed to make engineers thrive but economists quit.

                </p>
                <p>
                    So I found myself meeting all siblings and cousins of calculus. 
                    I went through differential, integral, and vector calculus, plus differential equations and the obvious linear algebra. 
                    All while shaking my head at the occasional “practical” example that was being thrown at us from thermodynamics...
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you are learning a subject that is difficult to you, and as abstract as math can be, 
                    adding the right narrative matters. It can't be all drill and persist. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yet it’s very rare to experience that sort of learning from your typical lecture. Real learning
                    is found elsewhere. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    That’s why I carefully design and create courses that give people easy access to the knowledge they need.
                    A learning experience they deserve. Built to engage, clarify, and boost results. 
                </p>
