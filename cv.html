            <h2 id="present">Data Analytics Consultant | Statistics and Econometrics Training</h2>
            <h3>2014-Present  |
                <i class="fa fa-map-marker"></i> Berlin, DE
            </h3>
            <p>
                In the last five years, I've helped students and professionals build their data analysis skills
                so they can get important projects done and produce results they can feel proud of. 
            </p>
            <p>
                My approach to training and consulting works because I design my courses to increase the moments of insight 
                for my students and clients. I care about helping others who want or need to use data analysis methods
                but feel overwhelmed or unsure about where to start. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Master's and PhD students from the top universities in Berlin (FU, HU, TU) have trusted me to 
                teach them how to apply econometric methods and statistics and how to succeed at high-demanding courses.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have also helped professionals acquire analytical skills for a new job or work project. 
                Application areas involved finance, labor economics, competition economics, and policy.
            </p>
            <!-- <div class="techniques">
                Here are some techniques and areas I can help you with:

            <p>
                To automate and optimized data analysis workflows I have used popular and relevant analysis tools.
                My experience includes working and giving training in programming languages for data analysis like R and Mathematica, 
                as well as BI tools like Microsoft Power BI.

                I gained a Master of Science in Economics from Freie Universität Berlin. 
                I have a bachelor's degree in the same field with outstanding academic performance, and 
                studied one year at Bremen University of Applied Sciences.

            <p>
                My primary field of interest was <i>Quantitative Methods</i> and their application. 
                So I completed the following courses:
            </p>
            <p>
                <ul>

               For my Master thesis, I did research on the use of remedies in EU merger control. 
               To conduct the analysis, I automated the data collection of online documents on merger cases 
               published by the European Commission.

                Although I had met all requirements for graduation, it seemed natural to me to work on a 
                thesis and do empirical work. I did research on consumption debt and
                how it interacts with income, interest rate, unemployment, and consumer confidence. 
                I chose Argentina as a case study to do the analysis under normal scenarios and economic crisis.
