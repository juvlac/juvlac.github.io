            Take up any challenge around data, statistics, and econometrics,

            You don’t have to be on your own. I’m here to help you the way I have already helped others 
            completing their projects and achieving great results.

        <p>
            What results can you expect when you work with me? 
        </p>
        <p>
            Well, after taking one-on-one training and advice from me, students have achieved 
            top grades for their Master’s theses in Economics, Finance, and Business (and have learned more within a month 
            than during their entire program). They've felt proud of having learned stuff that seemed too hard 
            and inaccessible. But more importantly, they reached their goal of getting a graduate degree, and 
            gained incredible confidence to start a great career.
            
        </p>
        <p>
            For others is all about passing that exam they had been putting off for a while. 
            Once they decided to try my classes, they got a double reward&mdash;they could finally check the box on 
            the task <i>and</i> enjoy doing much better than expected, telling me 
            <i>“I could not have been happier, I was totally expecting either to fail or to get 4 
                but I got 3.3, I was jumping up and down with joy yesterday.”</i> 

        </p>
        <p>
            In a job context, I've helped professionals get new analytical skills for a new job or promotion. 
            With my custom training, they feel competent real fast and ready to shine with confidence. 

        </p>
        <p>If it sounds like you could use my help, here’s a short version of how we can work together:</p>
        <p><span class="remark">1:1 Training:</span> This is you and me, working together comfortably so you can feel free to ask “silly” questions while you get the skills you need and knowledge that sticks.</p>
        <p><span class="remark">Consulting:</span> You bring the problem(s), I give you targeted solutions and strategies. 
            You’ll be teaming up with me to get better and faster results when the job or project you are doing
            involves aspects of data analysis or statistics that you are not familiar with.</p>
